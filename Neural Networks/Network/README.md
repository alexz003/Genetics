# Network

# About
An attempt to implement a simple network diagram consisting of some input, a few neurons, and the resulting output.

# Current Function
v.2.5 The multi-layered feed forward implementation has been added. Allows multiple starting point to propogate through the neural network.

v.2 A simulation of how the information propagates throughout the network is now animated.

v.1 Simple diagram displaying the neurons and connections between then. The thickness of the line is determined by the weight of the connection.
