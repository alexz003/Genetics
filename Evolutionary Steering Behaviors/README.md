# Evolutionary Steering Behaviors

## About
Using Daniel Shiffmans tutorial, I implement his basic Evolutionary Steering Behaviors.

## Current Function
Using a guided steering force, the vehicles develop different percption radii for food and poison to move towards. Ideally, the perception radius for food would be rather large and the perception radius for poison would be short. This way the vehicle can get closer to poison when looking for food and also pick up food that may be close to poison.
