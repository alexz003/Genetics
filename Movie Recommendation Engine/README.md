# Movie Recommendation Engine

## About
Using a dataset of ratings for the Star Wars movies, create an algorithm that predicts star ratings for movies you haven't seen yet using kNN or Nearest Neighbor with a similarity score. Similarity score is chosen using a dropdown. Both Euclidean and Pearson scoring are available.

## Current Function
v.3 Displays top 5 closest users in similarity score (kNN). Each user is checked against every other user.

v.2 Now has an option to display the Pearson Correlation Coefficient as the similarity score.

v.1 Displays the Euclidean similarity score based on the two entrants selected.
